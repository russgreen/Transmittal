The first button will open the Transmittal Wizard. It's very similar to using Transmittal from within Revit except you can record the transmittal of any document. Add documents to the list by clicking on the add new document row or dragging and dropping files onto the grid. If the file names conform to the file naming rule configured in settings the filename will be parsed and the different parts used to populate the columns in the grid. A file with a non-conforming file name can still be added but the values will all need to be set manually.

Select the distribution option and click Finish to record the transmittal to the database and generate a transmittal report.
